# Market Simulator

A deterministic, event-driven market simulator written in C++.

This project models a simplified exchange as a discrete-time world
with partial observability and hidden state. It is designed as a
systems-first simulator and later used to train and evaluate
learning-based world models.

## Goals
- Event-driven architecture
- Deterministic simulation
- CPU-efficient execution
- Clean separation of system and learning code

## Status
Work in progress.
